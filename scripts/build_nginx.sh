# Build NGINX and modules on Heroku.
# This program is designed to run in a web dyno provided by Heroku.
# We would like to build an NGINX binary for the builpack on the
# exact machine in which the binary will run.
# Our motivation for running in a web dyno is that we need a way to
# download the binary once it is built so we can vendor it in the buildpack.
#
# Once the dyno has is 'up' you can open your browser and navigate
# this dyno's directory structure to download the nginx binary.

# NGINX coming from google's script that includs PageSpeed module
